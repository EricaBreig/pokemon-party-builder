## User Story
```
As an aspiring pokémon trainer, I want to build a 6-pokemon party to begin my quest, to be the very best there ever was!

* GIVEN when I begin to build my pokémon party:
* WHEN I click on a party slot to add a pokémon,
* THEN I am taken to another page to search for my desired pokémon for this slot.
* WHEN I am searching for a pokémon to add,
* THEN I can choose to search by name, or search for filtered options.
* WHEN I confirm a pokémon selection,
* THEN said pokémon will appear in the party container on the first page.
* WHEN I am building my party roster,
* THEN the pokémon choices will fill from left to right, top to bottom.
* WHEN I have finished selecting my party,
* THEN I am presented with my selected pokémon saved to my local storage.
```
