# Pok√©mon Party Creator

## User Story
As an aspiring pokemon trainer, I want to build a 6-pokemon party to begin my quest to be the very best there ever was!

* GIVEN when I begin to build my pokemon party:
* WHEN I click on a party slot to add a pokemon,
* THEN I am taken to another page to search for my desired pokemon for this slot.
* WHEN I am searching for a pokemon to add,
* THEN I can choose to search by name, or search for filtered options.
* WHEN I confirm a pokemon selection,
* THEN said pokemon will appear in the party slot on the first page.
* WHEN I am building my party roster,
* THEN the pokemon choices will fill from left to right, top to bottom.
* WHEN I have finished selecting my party,
* THEN I am presented with the option to progress to a "Congratulations" screen.
