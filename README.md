# Pok√©mon Party Creator

## User Story
As an aspiring pokemon trainer, I want to build a 6-pokemon party to begin my quest to be the very best there ever was!

GIVEN when I begin to build my pokemon party:
WHEN I click on a party slot to add a pokemon,
THEN I am taken to another page to search for my desired pokemon for this slot.
WHEN I am searching for a pokemon to add,
THEN I can choose to search by name, or search for filtered options.
WHEN I confirm a pokemon selection,
THEN said pokemon will appear in the party slot on the first page.
